## About Me

I'm a passionate technologist driven by the desire to solve real-world problems using code. My interests lie at the intersection of **software engineering and cloud infrastructure**.

Most of the repositories on this GitHub profile were created during my **undergraduate internships and personal learning journey** — specifically while working on **J2EE-based projects**. These projects helped me gain practical skills, understand system-level challenges, and experiment with modern architecture patterns. However, at the present time I am accomplishing something else which is on my task list so it is possible that I am not active here but you can contact me through linkedin or Email provided here.
